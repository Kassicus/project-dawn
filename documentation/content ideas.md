# Gameplay Feautres

## Story?

## Gameplay Loop
Player spawns at the entrance to a dungeon (maybe they are sent there?) and they must run around killing hostile creatures and collecting their souls that they can then trade in for better equipment and items

Only souls will be picked up in the level, everything else will be bought with souls in the shops outside of the dungeon

# Things to Implement
