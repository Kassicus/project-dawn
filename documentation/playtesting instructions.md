# Playtesting Instructions

## Installing and Environment Setup
Before you can playtest, you have to do the one time setup of your python environment.

The first step is to download python (we are developing in version 3.10.7, but as a playtester any version that matches or is newer than that will work).

### Windows Users
- Download python from the windows store.
- Open up windows terminal and type `pip install pygame` this will automatically download and install the latest version of pygame.

### Mac/Linux Users
- Download python from the python downloads page [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Open up a terminal and type `pip install pygame` this will automatically download and install the latest version of pygame.

Download the code from the github page (or clone the git if you have an account or know how to do that).

Extract the code files to a folder (I recommend extracting to your documents folder).

Open a terminal window in the location of the `main.py` file and run the command `python3 main.py` this will launch the game.
